# Comprehensive Cleanup & Optimization Report

## Progress
1. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Created `css/mobile-fixes.css` to provide targeted fixes for mobile devices.
   - Standardized Hero Section heights (60vh) and Navigation padding (80px) for mobile.
   - Fixed mobile Grid layouts for tours and contact forms.
   - Ensured buttons expand to full width on small screens for better touch targets.

2. **Visual Consistency**
   - Applied unified `logo-entrance.css` for a smooth, premium logo fade-in effect.
   - Standardized Hero Section text sizing and overlay styles.
   - Fixed header heights and scroll offsets.

3. **Pages Updated**
   - `index.html`
   - `tours.html`
   - `contact.html`
   - `about.html`
   - `blog.html`
   - `customize-trip.html`

## Next Steps
- Automate the application of these fixes to all 70+ inner pages (Tour Details, Blog Posts) if desired.
- Perform a final image optimization pass (lossless compression) if needed.
